*Text adventure engine which reads off a bunch of dictionaries to make a game. Pretty proud of this one too, but seriously nesting lists/dictionaries and them looping through them is a mess. This is decently old, so I was probably not aware of `enumerate()`*

I'm not going to write a DOC for this one. Check *game_data.py* and read the comments, they are decently helpful. Keep in mind that you do have to run *engine_main.py* and update the import declaration at the top of it to bring in a new game.

Also this really should be object-oriented. Why did I write this like this?!
